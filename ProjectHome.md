This is a part of a [Very Rapid Management Applications Development](http://liberlog.fr/RAD-HTML-EN/VRAD-LAZARUS.html) framework project for DELPHI 2006 and [LAZARUS](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/).

There is no Object-relational mapping needed to create the HMI, so less memory needed. The next step is to create the database, actually upgrading. Also software is running on client or in 3-tier. There is a [VRAD](http://liberlog.fr/RAD-HTML-EN/VRAD-LAZARUS.html) framework named [XML Frames](http://xmlframes.liberlog.fr/). It uses [Man Frames](http://manframes.liberlog.fr/).

The micro-components, in [Extended Package](http://extended.liberlog.fr/), are informed by data or form properties with the management components, the Framework Form.

You can create quickly with this framework a customized Rich Management Software.

There is :
  * Child data form built with data or properties
  * Main Form built with data, with menus, languages
  * Data management buttons filling and original components

In Mansoft package you have :
  * An entirely data built management software with menus, admin, language management.
  * An administrator form with a relation-ships example

## Install ##

ManFrames needs JvXPBar components, Expert Super Form, Extended components, VirtualTreeView component, Menu Toolbar, RXÂ Suite, etc. These are on http://www.lazarus-components.org.


## Project History ##

The packages Extended and Man Frames have been created in Microcelt to create management softwares. Before sharing them, Matthieu Giroux has reviewed them to to separate projects, because there were 2 objectives in the original package.

You can participate to the project asking to author.
